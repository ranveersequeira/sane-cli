# React Project Setup CLI Tool

## Overview

Welcome to the React Project Setup CLI Tool! This tool will quickly create a React project with:
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- **React Router** for navigation.
- **Private Routes** for authenticated pages.
- A basic layout with a **Header**, **SideMenu**, and **Main** content area.

### Features:
- **Tailwind CSS** is configured out of the box.
- **React Router** with **Private Routes** to protect authenticated pages.
- A basic **Header** component and a **SideMenu** with placeholder items.
- A **Main** content area that you can customize with children components.

## Prerequisites

Before running this CLI tool, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** version 18 or higher.  
  You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v`.  
  If you don't have Node.js 18+, [download it here](https://nodejs.org/).
  
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install dependencies.  
  You can check your npm version by running `npm -v`.  
  If you don't have npm, install it along with Node.js.

> **Pro tip:** If you are using `nvm` (Node Version Manager), you can easily switch between Node.js versions!

## How to Use

1. **Install the CLI Tool**  
   Clone this repository or install the CLI tool globally for easy access.

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-link.git
   cd react-project-cli
   npm install -g
   ```

2. **Run the CLI Tool**  
   To generate a new React project, simply run:

   ```bash
   create-react-project <your-project-name>
   ```

   If no project name is provided, it will default to `my-app`.

## Example Project Structure

Once the tool runs, you'll have a project with the following structure:

```
/my-app
  /src
    /components
      Header.js
      SideMenu.js
      Main.js
    App.js
  tailwind.config.js
  vite.config.js
  package.json
  public/index.html
```

- **Header.js**: Contains a simple header layout.
- **SideMenu.js**: Contains a basic side navigation menu.
- **Main.js**: Displays the main content passed as children.
- **App.js**: Sets up the router and includes a Private Route for authenticated users.

---

## How Private Routes Work

This tool includes a **PrivateRoute** component that protects routes from unauthorized access. You can customize the authentication logic inside `PrivateRoute.js`. For now, it's simply based on a dummy boolean value (`isAuthenticated`).

```javascript
const PrivateRoute = ({ element }) => {
  const isAuthenticated = true; // Change this to real authentication logic
  return isAuthenticated ? element : <h2>You need to log in to access this page.</h2>;
};
```

---

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, here are a few things to check:
1. Ensure you're running **Node.js 18+** and **npm**.
2. Make sure all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install` in the project directory.
3. Verify the `vite.config.js` file exists and is properly configured.

## Jokes to Keep You Going

- Why did the JavaScript developer go broke?  
  Because he kept using `var` instead of `let` and `const`!

- Why do developers prefer dark mode?  
  Because light attracts bugs!

- If a React developer falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it still **re-render**?
