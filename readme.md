# Vite Sane CLI (Node >= 18.20.4)

Welcome to **Vite Sane CLI** – the tool for developers who are bored and scared to start a new step for their React application! Starting a new project can be terrifying (trust me, I get it). You sit there, wondering, "What am I getting myself into?" But fear not! With my sane defaults (and, let's be honest, **questionable** experience in the industry 😅), I've created this CLI to help you get up and running with a React app and start working **immediately**.

It's like having a cheat code for your React development. You don’t need to worry about setting up configurations, it’s all set up for you – just focus on your code!

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS by default** (because who doesn’t love that sweet utility-first goodness? 😍)
- **React** – The most popular library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM** – So you can navigate your app with ease.
- **React Redux** – For state management like a pro (unless you prefer SWR or React Query for data fetching, then it’s up to you!).
- Choose between **Ant Design 5** or **MUI** for your component library.
- Data fetching setup with either **SWR** or **React Query** – because who has time for manual API calls?
- Progressive improvements based on my own learning and growing with Vite! Expect updates as I get smarter about this tool.

## Why Vite Sane CLI?

Let's face it – Create React App is dead. It’s like the old-school flip phone that made you "cool" for a while but now it's gathering dust in your drawer. With **Vite Sane CLI**, we’re bringing the **future** of React development into the present. Fast, efficient, and built for the modern web developer who just wants to **build**.

## Future Focus

- **Module Federation** – Let’s make your React app shareable with other projects!
- **Extra Vite Configurations and Plugins** – For bigger, more complex projects.
- **Enterprise-level Setup** – Because your code should be as scalable as your ambition.

Joke on me: Starting a new project is like opening a mystery box – you have no idea what's inside, but you just hope it's not a bug-infested mess. 😅

Hope this helps you get started and reduces the “new project anxiety”! Now, go ahead and build something amazing – quickly and efficiently.
